Hi there, and welcome!

My intention with this blog is keeping track of my researched topics that I don't want to forget ("mental notebook") and which may be helpful to others. This may include code snippets and/or TLDR explanations.

Later I may introduce other topics too, but the primary focus of this blog will be related to software engineering. Topics I'm interested in are:
- Algorithms and data structures
- Artificial Intelligence
- Distributed systems
- Mathematics
- Astronomy
- Photography.

My editorial method will focus on brevity. I will try to keep everything as short as possible, I will not try to explain everything from the basics, some prior knowledge will be assumed.

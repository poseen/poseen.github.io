As a seasoned software engineer with over 14 years of experience, I bring a strong work ethic and a "decide it, own it, get it done" attitude to my work. I'm passionate about exploring and experimenting with modern technologies and constantly seeking ways to improve my skills.

I'm a firm believer in clean-code and well-defined coding standards, as well as maintaining developer-friendliness. I'm also a big fan of automation and keeping documentation up-to-date.

Currently based in Hungary, I'm open to relocation opportunities and have a particular interest in working in Canada or Japan.
